#### HANA

> `High-Performance Analytic Appliance` 高性能分析引用

* 支持全部事务，以及多种高级分析功能的数据库系统
* 大内存提供，关系型内存数据库
* 是平台，在这个平台之上用户可以构建数据仓库或集市、报表和仪表盘等
* 列存与内存计算做了大量的优化，大量分析型业务都直接构筑于column-store之上；同时，row-store则提供常规的OLTP功能，数据载入后根据策略来定期合并到列存之中。

* HANA已经是一个生态健全，各方面都很领先的内存数据库了，**即便Oracle也无法再撼动它的地位。**

以前SAP的ERP底层大多都是Oracle，HANA起来之后慢慢都替换为了HANA，SAP多赚多少，Oracle就要损失多少。自此，也算是SAP抄了Oracle的后院了。不过SAP在内存数据库领域做得风生水起的时候，显然在Cloud领域又慢了半拍，另一场大战就此拉开帷幕。

### 自我介绍

### 开头

it is really a great honor to have this opportunity for a interview，

```shell
as you can see from resume， I born in 1992, 30 years old, married and have a son,and lived in xian.

after graduated， first 3 years I worked at TW, as a Data Developer, go throght about 4 projects, all those project involved Machine learning platform, DataWare House, Refactoring historical system. by the way my role in thoes peoject is changed, during developed Machine learning platform, that named UNIML，as soft developer, I develpoed 3 main function modules dataset modules for show data detail and metadata. feature engineer modules for deal data pipeline. as a data engineer I deveploed spark job and spark secondary development and optimize it.
